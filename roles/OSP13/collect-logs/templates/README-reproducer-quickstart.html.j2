<h1>How to reproduce a job result using the reproducer-quickstart.sh script</h1>
<p>Check the top-level logs directory for a file <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b>.
Running this file will set up a stack on a personal tenant where the job run
can be reproduced.
If no <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b> file is found, that usually means an
infra failure before Quickstart could start or a problem in collecting logs.
Check on IRC Freenode channel <i>#tripleo</i> to see if there's an ongoing infra
issue.</p>

<h2>What is the reproducer-quickstart.sh script?</h2>
<p>A <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b> script is generated at the top-level log directory
for jobs that run TripleO-Quickstart and toci_gate_test-oooq.sh. Running the script
from a host machine will set up a stack to the point where the user can ssh to the
undercloud, source a variable file, and run <b>toci_gate_test-oooq.sh</b>. As such,
reproducing the complete jobs result requires some manual interaction.</p>

<p>The <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b> script is generated to be specific to that
job and <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b> scripts from other jobs will be different.</p>

<h2>Running the reproducer-quickstart.sh script</h2>
<p>Use <code>cURL</code>, <code>wget</code> or a similar tool to copy the
<b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b> to a clean working directory on a host from
where you can access the cloud tenant you want to run the reproducer on.
Make sure that the copied script is executable (has +x permissions) before you
attempt to run it.

<b>Source the tenant credentials before running the script.</b>

Also, it is a good idea to check that the tenant has enough capacity
and resources to reproduce the job before you begin.</p>

<p>Note that, by default, the <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b>
 script is written to run an a personal RDO Cloud tenant. Instructions on how to
modify the script to run on another host cloud are included in a section below.</p>

<p>When the script completes, you will see a list of instructions printed out on how
to run <b>toci_gate_test-oooq.sh</b> from the undercloud:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ssh to the undercloud: $ ssh zuul@$ansible_host</code></li>
<li><code>Source the environment settings file: $ source /home/zuul/env_vars_to_src.sh</code></li>
<li><code>Run the toci gate script: $ /opt/stack/tripleo-ci/toci_gate_test-oooq.sh</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Input argument options in the reproducer-quickstart.sh script</h2>
<p>Running <code>reproducer-quickstart.sh --help</code> will show a list of the
input options. All the options have a default and none are required.
The options are listed below with explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-w, --workspace</code>: directory where the virtualenv, inventory files, etc.
Defaults to creating a directory in /tmp</li>
<li><code>-v, --create-virtualenv</code>: create a virtualenv to install Ansible and dependencies.
Defaults to true.</li>
<li><code>-r, --remove-stacks-keypairs</code>: delete all stacks in the tenant before deployment.
will also delete associated keypairs if they exist.
Defaults to false.</li>
<li><code>-p, --nodestack-prefix</code>: add a unique prefix for multinode and singlenode stacks
Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using an alternative host cloud</h2>
<p>The <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b> script is written to run an a personal RDO Cloud tenant.
If you want to run on a different host cloud, modify the <b>reproducer-quickstart.sh</b> as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add git clone of <code>tripleo-environments</code> or any other repository containing
the cloud details, after cloning <code>tripleo-quickstart-extras</code></li>
<li>Add the repository to quickstart-extras-requirements.txt:
<code>echo "file://$WORKSPACE/tripleo-environments/#egg=tripleo-environments" >>
$WORKSPACE/tripleo-quickstart/quickstart-extras-requirements.txt</code></li>
<li>Use that host cloud's environment file in place of RDO Cloud's environment file.</li>
</ul>
